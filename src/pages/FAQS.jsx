      <h1 > Q: My computer powers on, but nothing shows on the screen </h1> 
<p> 
A: Double check your monitor is connected to your PC correctly. If it is, then you may want to try an alternative monitor. Your PC should have a small speaker inside. When you turn your PC on you should hear a single beep. This is called a ‘POST’ beep, and tells you the PC is booting up fine. If you don’t hear this or hear multiple successive beeps then you could have a hardware fault and we’d recommend giving us a call.</p>
